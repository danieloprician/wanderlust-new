Large common area with perfectly equipped kitchen. We cooked several meals in the kitchen and felt at home, the espresso machine is fantastic, better than what we have at home. I would love to visit in summer to enjoy the outdoor cooking facilities. Overall wonderful and excellent value for money!"
